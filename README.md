# Real-Time Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on building and deploying a **real-time object detection system** for autonomous vehicles. The system detects and classifies objects in driving environments — such as **pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, and obstacles** — to enhance safety and decision-making during autonomous driving.

Key challenges addressed include:

* Detecting objects in **varied lighting conditions** (day/night).
* Handling **different road types and weather conditions**.
* Maintaining **real-time performance** for safe deployment.

## 🚀 Features

* **Object Detection Models**: Implementations of YOLO, SSD, and Faster R-CNN.
* **Transfer Learning** with pre-trained weights (e.g., COCO dataset).
* **Real-Time Inference** integrated with onboard vehicle cameras.
* **Robust Preprocessing**: Data augmentation, normalization, and resizing.
* **MLOps Integration**: Continuous monitoring, retraining, and performance tracking.
* **Deployment Ready**: Supports TensorFlow Serving, ONNX, and real-time video streams.
